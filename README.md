### pipebin

A terminal pastebin clone that's ok with bytestrings. Inspired by termbin (fiche) and sprunge. But I wanted one that is platform independent, in python, uses sockets for read and write, a interface for frontend parsing, and decently handles bytestrings.

  - [x] Socket server
  - [x] Web read front-end
  - [ ] Decrypt with GPG public key from keyserver
  - [ ] Parse as markdown web front-end
  - [ ] AES-CBC decryption web front-end
  - [ ] Front-end syntax highlighter
